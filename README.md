# UltraSafe
This repo will contain the code needed to create the initial dataset of the medical images. The data is being collected, processed, cleaned and then sent to the clinic in order to attach the corresponding diagnoses found in the PACS system. After that, images are being de-identified and re-identified for privacy issues. In this way the dataset can be reused for other research purposes.
In this repo you will not find the processed images dataset due to privacy issues and further use of it by the authors.
